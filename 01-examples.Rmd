  <source src="videos/smallvid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

```{block2, type = 'rmdcaution'}
  videos embeded based on html syntax (see above) are not displayed in the PDF.
```

## Images

```{r echo=FALSE, fig13,fig.cap="This is R Syntax", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example-images2.jpg")
```

This is a reference to Fig. \@ref(fig:fig13).

![This is Rmarkdown Syntax](images/example-images2.jpg){width="460" height="315"}

```{block2, type = 'rmdcaution'}
Image referencing is not possible by means of RMarkdown syntax.
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
It is advisable to stick to a syntax within a document (Rmarkdown or R).
```


##Headlines

* Heading 1 - <#Heading Title>
* Heading 2 - <##Heading Title>
* Heading 3 - <###Heading Title>
* Heading without numbering - <# Title {-}>
* Appendix - <## (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}>

##Referencing

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
The reference list in html is generated by means of an r statement (see 04-references.Rmd).
YAML Metadata parameters in index.Rmd are used to render the reference list in PDF.
If "link-citations: yes" is enabled, reference list will be added to the end of every chapter (not alphabetical!).

## CSS Text formatting{.emphasized}

<span class="emphasized">Pay attention to this!</span>

```{block2, type = 'rmdcomment'}
The css class "emphasized" is defined in css/custom.css and may be applied to text and headlines using HTML tags.
Classes assigned to headlines are applied in the entire chaper.More information on css customization in BookDown is available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/custom-css-1.html).
Formats based on css are not rendered in the PDF!
