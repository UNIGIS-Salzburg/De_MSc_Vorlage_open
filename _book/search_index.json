["introduction-to-bookdownplus.html", "Lektion 2 Introduction to Bookdownplus 2.1 Features 2.2 Quick start 2.3 Results 2.4 Conclusions", " Lektion 2 Introduction to Bookdownplus The R package bookdownplus (???) is an extension of bookdown (???). It is a collection of multiple templates on the basis of LaTeX, which are tailored so that I can work happily under the umbrella of bookdown. bookdownplus helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries. This is a comment block This is a caution block This is an insight block. This is an exercise block. This is a tip block. 2.1 Features bookdownplus extends the features of bookdown, and simplifies the procedure. Users only have to choose a template, clarify the book title and author name, and then focus on writing the text. No need to struggle in YAML and LaTeX. With bookdownplus users can record guitar chords, write a mail in an elegant layout, write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary, draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar, and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way, with chemical molecular formulae and equations, even in Chinese, and more wonders will come soon. Full documentation can be found in the book R bookdownplus Textbook. The webpage looks so-so, while the pdf file might give you a little surprise. 2.2 Quick start Although this section might not be the latest version, the general idea won’t change. Please see R bookdownplus Textbook to keep up with the update. 2.2.1 Preparation Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and other software and packages (i.e. Pandoc, LaTeX, rmarkdown, rticle, knitr, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official manual of bookdown for details. Additionally, if you want to produce a poster, phython must be installed before using, and the path of phython might have to be added to the environmental variables for Windows users. 2.2.2 Installation install.package(&quot;bookdownplus&quot;) # or devtools:: install_github(&quot;pzhaonet/bookdownplus&quot;) 2.2.3 Generate demo files Run the following codes, and you will get some files (e.g. index.Rmd, body.Rmd, bookdownplus.Rproj) and folders in your working directory. getwd() # this is your working directory. run setwd() to change it. bookdownplus::bookdownplus() 2.2.4 Build a demo book Now open bookdownplus.Rproj with RStudio, and press ctrl+shift+b to compile it. Your will get a book file named *.pdf in _book/folder. 2.2.5 Write your own Write your own text in index.Rmd and body.Rmd, and build your own lovely book. 2.2.6 More outputs By default, the book is in a pdf file. From ‘bookdownplus’ 1.0.3, users can get more output formats, including ‘word’, ‘html’ and ‘epub’. Run: bookdownplus:: bookdownplus(template = &#39;article&#39;, more_output = c(&#39;html&#39;, &#39;word&#39;, &#39;epub&#39;)) 2.2.7 Recommendations I have been developing some other packages, which bring more features into ‘bookdown’, such as: mindr (???), which can extract the outline of your book and turn it into a mind map, and pinyin (???), which can automatically generate ‘{#ID}’ of the chapter headers even if there are Chinese characters in them. Both of them have been released on CRAN and can be installed via: install.packages(&#39;mindr&#39;) install.packages(&#39;pinyin&#39;) Enjoy your bookdowning! 2.2.8 Models Eq. (2.1) is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] It can be written as \\(E = mc^2\\). Theorem 2.1 This is a theorem. Proof. This is a proof.
